## Propeller Toy/Collaborative Onshape
### Assignment
For this assignment, two students were to create a small toy that would launch a propeller when you
pulled a cord, learning about Onshape's collaboration features along the way. Partners were assigned
different tasks by the assignment that could be done in paralell. For example, one student might be
designing the propeller while the other designed the pull cord.
