# Hi!
You're seeing this because, for Reasons, I can't directly link to the barcode generator page from High Seas. If you want to do this the fun way, scan the QR code (may not work with mobile scanners, try a website like [scanqr.org](https://scanqr.org)), then visit the URI it contains. That page is entirely self-contained in the QR code.

If you want to do this the fast way, you can also [click here](/random-raw-files/upcinqr.html) to visit the page directly, although that version is actually hosted on the internet and therefore less cool.
