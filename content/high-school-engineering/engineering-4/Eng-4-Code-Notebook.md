## Media test:

## Launchpad part 1
This is the first in a series of assignments in which I build a simulated launchpad. For this assignment I just had to make the Pico count down from 10 to 1 in the console.
### Media

### Wiring
No wiring was needed for this assignment.
### Reflection
This was a nice test project to make sure I had everything configured properly. (I didn't.) I ended up changing upload toolchains from MicroPython to my CPyProjectTemplate, remembering to change the board type from last year's Metro Express to the Pico W. There was also a good bit of fighting with Git over this change, and after running into errors tring to `git revert` a few times, I ended up deleting the repo and starting over from the template, which wasn't a huge problem because I hadn't done much work in the deleted repo.
## Launchpad part 2
This is the second assignment in the launchpad series. We had to add a red flashing light to the Pico that blinked in sync with the countdown, and a green light that turned on at liftoff.
### Media

### Wiring

### Reflection
This went mostly without hitches, but there was one nuance: When a CircuitPython ends, all hardware is deinitialized and set to an input. This turns off all connected components.
Because of this, when my program immediately ended after turning on the green LED it turned right back off. To prevent this I added an infinite loop at the end of the program.
## Launchpad part 3
This is the third assignment in the launchpad series. We added a button that could start and stop the countdown.
### Media

### Wiring

### Reflection
I did the spicy option here, which involved adding an abort button. This was non-trivial because I had to watch the button *while delaying.* A full async framework would have been overkill for this, so I just wait for 0.05 seconds then check the button for 20 times.
## Launchpad part 4
This is the fourth assignment in the launchpad series. We added a servo to "release the rocket" as the clock hit zero It had to start its move at T-3 and smoothly finish at T-0.
### Media

### Wiring

### Reflection
Having to make the servo move smoothly made me realize the way I wrote part 3 was *really inextensible.* I had apparently forgotten about being able to use `time.monotonic()` instead of `time.sleep()` for doing stuff while delaying. With the help of Arduino's `map()` function, I was able to get the servo moving pretty smoothly.
## Crash avoidance part 1
This is the first in a series of assignments in which I build a simulated crash avoicance system for a helicopter. For this assignment I had to read the acceleration values off on an accelerometer.
### Media

### Wiring
![The schematic](/docs/eng-4/crash1schem.png "The schematic for this assignment")
### Reflection
This went really smoothly. The one small hitch was that I forgot to put a `sleep()` in the main loop to begin with, so the accelerations were logged at max speed. I added a half-second sleep and everything was fine.
## Crash avoidance part 2
This is the second assignment in the crash avoidance series. I added an LED to indicate when the board was dangerously tilted and a battery so the board could be carried around.
### Media
![A GIF of the LED lighting as I turn the board around.](/docs/eng-4/crash2.gif "The danger LED illuminating.")
### Wiring
![The schematic](/docs/eng-4/crash2schem.png "The schematic for this assignment")
### Reflection
To detect if we're at a dangerous tile, I just check if the absolute value of the Z component of the acceleration is less than 1 m/sÂ². This is a fairly naive way of doing things, and if I wanted to detect a different angle I would need to do more complex trig. However, it works for this assignment, and it's simple, so it's staying.
## Crash avoidance part 3
This is the third assignment in the crash avoidance series. I added a gyroscpe to report rotation rate.
### Media

### Wiring

### Reflection
When I was making the schematic for part 3, things got a little more cluttered than I liked. To fix this, I used net labels for common power rails and busses to
reduce the number of wires in the schematic. It was a bit of a pain doing this now, and I should have done it from the start.
## Crash avoidance part 4
This is the fourth assignment in the crash avoidance series. I added an altimeter to not activate the altitude alarm if the board had risen at least 3 meters.
### Media
![A GIF of the LED not going off after I have gone up some stairs.](/docs/eng-4/crash4.gif "The light doesn't activate if I go upstairs.")
### Wiring
![The schematic](/docs/eng-4/crash4schem.png "The schematic for this assignment")
### Reflection
I had to relearn a bit of the Python f-string formatting language. ([Here's a link to the docs for the future.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec)) In this case I had to make a 3-digit fixed point representation of the number with a space used in place of a plus sign, so the code was `: .3f`.
## Landing zone part 1
This is the first in a series of assignments in which I build a simulated landing zone evaluator. For this assignment I just had to get the area of a single landing zone, using the power of functions.
### Media
![A GIF of the console working.](/docs/eng-4/land1terminal.gif "The console figuring out the area of a triangle.")
### Wiring
No wiring was needed for this assignment.
### Reflection
This was the first time I recorded my screen using WeVideo. I quickly discovered that it does not nicely scale up screen recordings. To work around this I used a massively zoomed in PowerShell terminal instead of the native VS Code terminal to run the code.
